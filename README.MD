# FABRIK IK Solver with Conic Limits

Simple implementation of the FABRIK (Forwards and backwards reaching inverse kinematics) algorithm. This implementation is created as an project for ROC Nijmegen (Software Development) classes. The target is to be able to solve human like skeletons in a fraction of a second, this algorithm both supports limited joints (with cones) and free joints.
